Over the past 10 months, I have been interning at Cisco as an IoT Sales Intern, on track to become an Account Manager when I graduate college. At school, I play on the Women's Club Lacrosse team, am a member of the business fraternity Phi Chi Theta, and host tours of the Rutgers Business School building. I also like to coach soccer and lacrosse and I work at Lululemon as an Educator.</p>
